# MangaNotifier
This is a widget for manga fans. Instead of RSS notifiers from different sites, this is a widget that polls from multiple sites.

Currently, we are trying to use Andriod visual studio to build this for android users.

We are using Python for web crawling.

#Installation

I use Oracle VM VirtualBox and use ubuntu for the environment.
https://www.virtualbox.org/
http://www.ubuntu.com/

We then used Atom within the ubuntu environment.
Download atom-amd64.deb from the Atom releases page.
Run sudo dpkg --install atom-amd64.deb on the downloaded package.
Launch Atom using the installed atom command.

Jordan Added setup script, so if you run it, it should good.
